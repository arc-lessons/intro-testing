    "Test-driven Development (TDD) takes the workflow of writing code and writing tests and turns it on its head. TDD is a software development process where you write the tests first. Before you write a single line of a function, you first write the test for that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you write a test, you are then allowed to proceed to write the function that you are testing. However, you are only supposed to implement enough of the function so that the test passes. If the function does not do what is needed, you write another test and then go back and modify the function. You repeat this process of test-then-implement until the function is completely implemented for your current needs."

    "\n",
    "The central claim to TDD is that at the end of the process you have an implementation that is well tested for your use case, and the process itself is more efficient. You stop when your tests pass and you do not need any more features. You do not spend any time implementing options and features on the off chance that they will prove helpful later. You get what you need when you need it, and no more. TDD is a very powerful idea, though it can be hard to follow religiously."
