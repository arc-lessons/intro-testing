    "The situation where the test examines either the beginning or the end of a range, but not the middle, is called an **edge case**. In a simple, one-dimensional problem, the two edge cases should always be tested along with at least one internal point. This ensures that you have good *coverage* over the range of values.\n",

When we ran the test it would then fail, creating an issue that we, or one of our colleagues could easily identify and ‘fix’.\n",

A further advantage of this approach is that it helps us to consider more features that our code needs to address than if we just write for a specific purpose. This means we take a defensive approach to our programming from the start, assuming that we wil make mistakes, and that our users will try to break our code."
