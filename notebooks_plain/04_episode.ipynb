    "In the previous lesson we wrote our function with its assertion in `notebooks`. As we have discussed previously, it is much more useful to write these as a script which we can then call, or in the case of libraries import. In this lesson we will write our mean function as a script and revise how to display documentation and call the function.  We will then explore how to include our own libraries within other scripts revise why it is good practice to include the main part of the script in its own function.\n",
