When `pytest` is run, it will search all directories below where it was called, find all of the Python files in these directories whose names start or end with `test`, import them, and run all of the functions and classes whose names start with `test` or `Test`. This automatic registration of test code saves tons of human time and allows us to focus on what is important: writing more tests (and the code to pass them!)."
